Hi :wave:! My name is Wade Johnson. I have been working out of my home office in Kelowna, BC for WTFast for the past 4.5 years as a 
Senior Software developer. I enjoy solving unique problems for [WTFast](https://wtfast.com) in the Core Technology group. I also love reading, learning, and side projects.  I am currently reading "Elm in Action" by Richard Felding in our company Functional Programming User Group that I started with a friend and co-worker. 

When I am not thinking about or solving problems, I could attacked at any moment by one of my 4 inquisitive kids. I love my wife and kids. I 
am a family man through and through.
